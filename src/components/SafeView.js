Malicious users on the web steal personal information, bring down sites, and exploit fundamental security flaws in web servers. all Solution tackles this problem by using new serverless technology to deliver your websites. No server means no reachable database for malicious requests, DDOS attacks, or accidental exposure.  The security of your digital footprint is something we donâ€™t take for granted."
